Day 1

 

The rain in this town arose suddenly at the beginning of the summer. The moist air filled with the smell of ferns mingled with earth. Rain fell down to the ground became turbulent of the stream running down the sewer.

People came in and out of the buildings of brick in minutes, with wet clothes, cold air, dripping hair and plastic umbrellas. Thermostat working unstopped, fan heater merrily blasted Kenny G. 

Inevitably, you are walking in this rain.
