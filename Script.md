Day 1

The rain in this town arose suddenly at the beginning of the summer. A mingled scent of ferns and earth hung in the moist air. Rain fell down to the ground and became turbulent of stream running down the sewer.

People came in and out of the buildings of brick in minutes, with wet clothes, cold air, dripping hair and plastic umbrellas. Thermostat working unstopped, fan heater merrily blasted Kenny G.

Inevitably, you were walking in this rain. "It's no big deal," you told yourself. Just picking up mails for the department office. A month of working this far seems merely to be a misuse of time. Under the dazzling artificial light, you sowed the pitcher plants' seeds into the ground, spread out new soil, poured in fertilizer. They consumed small lives, and grew fast, minute by minute, day by day, same as you.

Mist of dew
