#Day 1
The rain in this town arose suddenly at the beginning of the summer. A mingled scent of ferns and earth hung in the moist air. Rain fell down to the ground and became turbulent of stream running down the sewer.

People came in and out of the buildings of brick in minutes, with wet clothes, cold air, dripping hair and plastic umbrellas. Thermostat working unstopped, fan heater merrily blasted Kenny G.

Inevitably, you walked in this rain again. "It's no big deal," you told yourself. Just picking up mails for the department office. So far you were been working here for a month, but the job still seemly to be a misuse of time. Under the dazzling artificial light, you sowed the pitcher plants' seeds into the ground, spread out new soil, mixed with fertilizer. They consumed small lives, and grew fast, minute by minute, day by day, same as you.

You could feel the mist of rain on your face as someone's gentle kisses. You like this weather, as always. Expecially the chill wind after the stifling heat in the greenhouse. Through the mist, you saw a figure standing beside the window. Grey hair, light blue shirt, a glossy silver hoop rested on his left ring finger. While you watched his finger typing briskly upon the keyboard. He noticed you and turned his head towards you.

You...

Stopped and talked to him.
Kept going.
