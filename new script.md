>* [branch 1A]: branch A, choice No.1

[Beginning] A long time ago, there was an old story. When night fell, the last light of the day and the first light of the lighthouse interlaced at sea, a sorrowful song of the mermaid would come from afar. Rumor has it that there was a fisherman's son who came back from fishing at midnight, enchanted by the song to the center of the sea, rescued the injured mermaid [fight scene with the tentacle of the sea monster, the Kraken] and fell in love with her.

As the price of love, the mermaid lost her voice, and the boy went blind ever since. After that, the boy would found his lover on the reef, who was listening to the song from the sea in tears every night. One day, he decided to make his lover happy again. So he went back to the center of the sea and prayed to exchange his vocie for the mermaid's song. The sea witch heard the boy's petition, but the witch didn't want his voice. Instead, the witch asked him to hand over two things: the ability to love and the willingness to face the nightmare, [branch 1A: accept]* the boy hesitated, then agreed.

"And before you go, son." The witch said when the boy was ready to leave, "whenever you change your mind," she took out a poison bottle filled with green liquid, "this is the poison that can burn your throat. You will lose your voice when you drink it, but it is a way to retrieve the two things you have lost." [branch 1B: keep the poison]

When the boy finally groped back in the darkness and heard the mermaid's song again outside the door, he found his heart as dried as his empty eyes, as he could no longer feel the emotional waves like he used to. He started to fear that his emotionlessness would hurt his lover. *I must run away*, there was a voice hanging over his head. He touched the glass bottle in his pocket hesitatingly, [branch 1C: stay] but decided to give it a try.

The mermaid went out greeting him merrily, "Do you like my song?" she asked. 

"I don't know," the boy replied. *I can't feel anything, *he thought. 

"Was it bad?" the mermaid said sadly.

"It's beautiful, like always." The boy said, but in a flat tone. 

"Thank you," the mermaid said with a joyful smile on her face, "I'll sing to you eveyday."

The lullaby at night and the aubade at the morning sooner became torments for the boy. Something has changed radically, he knew. The sweet love song slowly became harsh noises in his ear, full of anger and hate. After a long time, the boy was not longer able to distinguish whether it was him or the entire world went wrong. Eveytime when he was feeling her body in hands, he could not be sure that she was still the girl that he once loved. [branch 1D: leave] Old-fashionedly, he decided to leave. At one night, the moonlight streamed through the window of the girl's bedroom. The boy sneaked in, watched her sleeping face for the last time. All of a sudden, the witchâ€™s words echoed in his ears,* drink the poison then you can be with her foverever*. His hand touched the glass bottle in his pocket, [branch 1E: drink]* if I could regain the love*, the boy thought, *I should be able to be happy and feel the love again, leaving her is something even more painful than blindness and voicelessness for the rest of the life.* He drank the poison determinedly. The enormous, burning pain from the throat instantly knocked him down. At the last second before he lost his conscious, the boy saw a picture that he and his lover were holding hands and walking into the morning sea. When he recovered from the faint, he is completely visionless and inarticulate. But he did not hear the beautiful voice from the mermaid like he was expected, only the harsh, ruthless curse, the most vicious, brutish scolds he had ever heard.

"Is that you? my love." The boy asked.

Knowing the boy has awaken, the mermaid turned her head and looked at him with a cheerful smile, revealing her bright fangs, "Yes, that's me."
