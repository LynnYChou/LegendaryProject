[*Beginning*] A long time ago, there was an old story. When night fell, the last light of the day and the first light of the lighthouse interlaced at sea, a sorrowful song of the mermaid would could be heard from afar. Rumor has it that there was a fisherman's son who came back from fishing at midnight, enchanted by the song to the center of the sea.

It was a clear cold night and the stars shone down upon the sea as bright and merciless as truth. As the boy proceeded to the source of the sound, the turbulent waves dragged his boat into a whirlpool.

*[battle with the tentacle of the sea monster, the Kraken]*

[branch 1A: won]* The boy rescued the injured mermaid and fell in love with her. As the price of forbidden love, the mermaid lost her voice ever since. After that, the boy would found his lover on the reef, who was listening to the song from the sea in tears every night. One day, he decided to make his lover happy again. So he went back to the center of the sea and prayed to exchange his vocie for the mermaid's song. The sea witch heard the boy's petition and appeared. [battle with the witch]

[branch 2B: lost]

[branch 1B: won] the witch agreed to help, but didn't want his voice. Instead, the witch asked him to hand over two things: the ability to love and the willingness to face the nightmare, [branch 1C: accept] the boy hesitated, then accepted. [branc 2C: deny]

"And before you go, son." The witch said when the boy was ready to leave, "whenever you change your mind," she took out a poison bottle filled with green liquid, "this is the poison that can burn your throat. You will lose your voice when you drink it, but it is a way to retrieve the two things you have lost." [branch 1D: keep the poison]

When the boy finally groped back in the darkness and heard the mermaid's song again outside the door, he found his heart as dried as his empty eyes, as he could no longer feel the emotional waves like he used to. He started to fear that his emotionlessness would hurt his lover. *I must run away*, a voice was hanging over his head. He stepped backward hesitatingly, [branch 1E: stay] but decided to give it a try.

The mermaid went out greeting him merrily, "Do you like my song?" she asked. 

"I don't know," the boy replied. *I can't feel anything, *he thought. 

"Was it bad?" the mermaid said sadly.

"It's beautiful, like always." The boy said, but in a flat tone. 

"Thank you," the mermaid said with a joyful smile on her face, "I'll sing to you eveyday."

The lullaby at night and the aubade at the morning sooner became torments for the boy. Something has changed radically, he knew. The sweet love song slowly became harsh noises in his ear, full of anger and hate. After a long time, the boy was not longer able to distinguish whether it was him or the entire world went wrong. Everytime when he was feeling her body in hands, he can't be sure that she was still the girl he once loved. [branch 1F: leave] Old-fashionedly, he decided to leave. At one night, the moonlight streamed through the window of the girl's bedroom. The boy sneaked in, watched her sleeping face for the last time. All of a sudden, the witchâ€™s words echoed in his ears,* drink the poison then you can be with her foverever*. His hand touched the glass bottle in his pocket, [branch 1G: drink]* if I could regain the love*, the boy thought, *I should be able to be happy and feel the love again, leaving her is something even more painful than voicelessness for the rest of the life.* He drank the poison determinedly. The enormous, burning pain from the throat instantly knocked him down. At the last second before he lost his conscious, the boy saw a picture that he and his lover were holding hands and walking into the morning sea. When he recovered from the faint, he is completely aphasiac. But he did not hear the beautiful voice from the mermaid like he was expected, only the harsh, ruthless curse, the most vicious, brutish scolds he had ever heard.

"Is that you? my love." The boy asked.

Knowing the boy has awaken, the mermaid turned her head and looked at him with a cheerful smile, revealing her bright fangs, "Yes, that's me." 

*[last battle with the mermaid]*

[branch 1H: won]

When the boy realized what he had done, he was holding the body of the mermaid in arms. Her blood was flooded all over him. She looked like an innocent, sleeping girl in his eyes who would never wake up again. Waves of emotion caught him upon. His heart was trembling, and his eyes were in tears.

A long time ago, there was a girl who lives in a small village. One day, the girl's father went fishing as usual. Unfortunately, the fishing boat was robbed by a group of pirates. The father's eyes were seriously injured that he couldn't work again and had to rest at home since then. The girl went to the city to sing for subsidizing her family. She was inherent in a good voice. The beautiful song attracted many people in the city to listen to. A rich businessman was pleased by the girl's singing and asked her to become his servant. A groom's boy heard it, hoping the girl could become his wife, and a hunter heard it, hoping to take the girl away. But the girl didn't want to go with any one of them and leave her disable father at home. One day, when the girl went out to the city again, the angry crowd caught and drowned the girl in the sea. Because of the regrets she had during her lifetime, her soul could not reincarnate thus became a ghost at sea. She sang a lonely song day and night, wishing to let her father hear. Many sailing fishermen were bewildered by the singing of the girl's ghost, lost their way, and eventually hit the reefs in the fog and died.
